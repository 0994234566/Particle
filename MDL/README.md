Modules
=======
This section is for individual modules featuring the most useful features from the main software for users that prefer to just use some features instead of all.

Users can request for other inexistent individual features to ship in modules, but it is not guaranteed to happen.

To request for a new module you may post in the issues forum with the title format `"[MDL R] XXXXX"` where `"XXXXX"` is a title of your choice.

Each module may be discontinued at any time, depending on the circumstances.
